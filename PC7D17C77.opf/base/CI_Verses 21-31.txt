From the interdependent self-nature Comes discrimination arising from conditions;The perfection
of the fruit comes from Always being apart from the former nature.

Therefore in relation to the interdependent, It is neither different nor is it not different,Just
like the nature of impermanence, etc., And when one is not perceived, the other is.

On the basis of the three kinds of self-nature Is established the threefold absence of self-nature;Thus
the Buddha spoke with the hidden intent That all dharmas are without nature.

The first is the naturelessness of characteristics, The next is the naturelessness of self-existence;The
last is the detachment from the first, When the natures of self and dharmas are
grasped.

This is the ultimate truth of all dharmas, And it is also the same as True Suchness.Because
its nature is eternally so, It is the true nature of Consciousness Only.

So long as one has not given rise to the consciousness Which seeks to abide in the nature of
Consciousness Only,Then regarding the two types of grasping dispositions, He is still not
yet able to subdue and extinguish them.

Setting up and establishing even something small And saying this is the nature of Consciousness
Only,Because there is still something which is grasped, It is not truly abiding in Consciousness
Only.

When one regards that which is conditioned With the wisdom of total non-appropriation,Then at
that time one abides in Consciousness Only, Apart from the duality of grasping at appearances.

Without grasping and not conceptualizingâ€” This is the wisdom of the supramundane realmWhich
abandons the coarseness of duality And naturally attains transformation of the basis.

This is itself the untainted realm, Inconceivable, good, and eternal,Peaceful and blissful,
the body of liberation, And what the great Muni called the Dharma.

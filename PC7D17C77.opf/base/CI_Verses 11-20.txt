The three roots such as desirelessness, etc.,And also vigor, peacefulness, vigilance, Equanimity,

With their basis in the root consciousness, The five consciousnesses manifest according to conditions;These
manifestations may occur together or separately, Just as waves are formed
upon the water.

The thought consciousness always manifests Except for those born in the heavens of no-thought,For
those in the two samƒÅdhis without thought, And for those in drowsiness or unconsciousness.

These various consciousnesses are transformed As discrimination and that which is discriminated,And
with this basis they are all empty; Thus they are all Consciousness Only.

Through the consciousness of all seeds, There are such-and-such transformations,And from the

From this and that imagination, One imagines all kinds of objects;These pervasive imagined objects
Are without actual self-nature.

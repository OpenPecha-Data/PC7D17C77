From the delusion of self and dharmas, Comes the conveyence of various manifestations;These
are supported and transformed by consciousness, And there are only three of these which may
transform.

These are retribution, thought, And the perception of external objects.The first of these is
the Ālaya Consciousness, Which is retribution as well as all the seeds.

Its grasping, location, and knowing are imperceivable, And it is always associated with mental
contact,Attention, sensation, conception, and thought; It is associated with neither pleasure
nor pain.

It is undefiled and morally indeterminate; Mental contact and the others are also like this.Its
conveyence is like that of a flowing stream,

And it is abandoned in the stage of the arhat.Next is the second which is able to transform,
And this consciousness is called Manas.It is supported by the previous conveyence, And its
character and nature are that of thought.

It is always associated with the four vexations, Which are delusion of a self, perception of
a self,Identity with a self, and love of a self, As well as mental contact and the others.It
is defiled and morally indeterminate,

And its location is bound to that of life.In arhats, in the Nirodha Samāpatti, And in the Supramundane
Path, it does not exist.

Next is the third which is able to transform, Which is distinguished into six different divisions;Its
appearance and nature are perceiving external objects, And these may be good, bad,
or indeterminate.

It is associated with omnipresent mental activities, With the external objects, the good, the
vexations,The secondary vexations, and the undetermined, And it is associated with all three
feelings.

Omnipresent mental activities are mental contact, etc.; Next are those with objects, which are
desires,Determination, mindfulness, samādhi, wisdom, etc., And the object of each of these
is not the same. The good are faith, conscience, a sense of shame,
